# Soundtrackr

Soundtrackr is a music analytics application that connects to a user’s Spotify account to analyze and provide personalized insights based on the user’s listening habits. The app retrieves Spotify listening activity to generate a personalized deep dive into the user’s top songs, genres, artists, albums, and recently played tracks. Additionally, it will feature general insights such as the top 100 tracks and artists. The data is presented through dynamic and interactive charts with the option to filter trends over different time frames (week, month, year, all-time). Soundtrackr also includes social features, allowing users to share insights and view other users’ profiles.
